# Overview

Foundry is an open source machine learning platform for scientists. Our core services are data storage, pre-trained models run with cloud computing, and an interface that makes both data and models easy to use and share.

Foundry primarily consists of datasets for materials science and chemistry, but we're continuing to expand to other areas.

Foundry's functionality is built on top of a variety of already existing services, bringing together useful tools and features into one easy-to-use platform.
